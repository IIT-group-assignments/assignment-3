        <h2>The Team Cauldron</h2>
        <p class="team__description">The team brings together a mixed bag of
          skills that could enable a
          successful IT business. Whilst the Easy Perf Check group may not
          possess all the required abilities to put the product in the market,
          the variety of experiences can certainly enable the team to
          collaborate with external sources and suppliers in order to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="team__description">The profiles in the group are mostly of 2
          different types that have
          commonalities and differences: the MBTI Protectors and Inspectors. The
          2 personality types make for a team that has strong focus on people
          and customer outcomes with the Protectors in the team, while the
          Inspectors prime on planning, organisation and logical delivery. Both
          profiles share characteristics, such as the goals-based approach to
          decision-making and logical, non-nonsense tackling of problems, in
          addition to superior work ethics and loyalty. </p>
        <p class="team__description">Having a clear understanding of how these 2
          profiles work together
          and each other’s strengths and challenges is paramount for success. It
          seems that collaboration between these 2 types is an easily achievable
          target. It is a matter of sharing the workload, taking benefit of each
          person’s preferences and abilities in a positive way. Both profiles
          tend to have high standards and could benefit from improvements in
          communication strategies, which could possibly create additional
          miscommunication challenges.</p>
