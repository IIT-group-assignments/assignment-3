        <h2>The Team Cauldron</h2>
        <p class="team__description">The team brings together a mixed bag of
          skills that could enable a
          successful IT business. Whilst the Easy Perf Check group may not
          possess all the required abilities to put the product in the market,
          the variety of experiences can certainly enable the team to
          collaborate with external sources and suppliers in order to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="team__description">The profiles in the group are mostly of 2
          different types that have
          commonalities and differences: the MBTI Protectors and Inspectors. The
          2 personality types make for a team that has strong focus on people
          and customer outcomes with the Protectors in the team, while the
          Inspectors prime on planning, organisation and logical delivery. Both
          profiles share characteristics, such as the goals-based approach to
          decision-making and logical, non-nonsense tackling of problems, in
          addition to superior work ethics and loyalty. </p>
        <p class="team__description">Having a clear understanding of how these 2
          profiles work together
          and each other’s strengths and challenges is paramount for success. It
          seems that collaboration between these 2 types is an easily achievable
          target. It is a matter of sharing the workload, taking benefit of each
          person’s preferences and abilities in a positive way. Both profiles
          tend to have high standards and could benefit from improvements in
          communication strategies, which could possibly create additional
          miscommunication challenges.</p>

            <p class="feature__paragraph">Grace brings to the table experience
              in diverse industries, such as Retail and Banking. Currently Grace
              works in a big4 Australian bank in the Anti-money Laundering and
              Counter-terrorism Unit, and is pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce,
              majoring in Finance and a minor in Business Strategy and Economic
              Management at UNSW. Grace’s interest in IT revolves around the
              ways in which IT, particularly Cyber Security and Artificial
              Intelligence can be applied to the Finance Industry.
            </p>
            <p class="feature__paragraph">Grace’s MBTI personality type is the
              ISFJ, “The Protector”, revealing a highly practical, compassionate
              and caring profile that enjoys contributing to established
              structures of society. Grace’s personality type strengths are:
              practical, hardworking, supportive, and loyal. However, ISFJs can
              usually improve collaboration by working on their resistance to
              change, altruisms, taking things less personally, and management
              of their workload.</p>
