        <h2 class="project__heading">Project Description</h2>
        <p class="lead">With Easy Perf Check your users can run network
          diagnostics from the comfort of their home with the
          click of a button. The results are sent to you and you can
          provide adequate support.</p>
        <p class="lead">This project will create a tool, that would be a great
          addition to a
          Network engineer’s toolkit. By making a substantial improvement to the
          existing iPerf software, we are creating a user interface that is:</p>
        <ul class="project__list">
          <li class="project__list-item lead">Portable</li>
          <li class="project__list-item lead">Requiring no software installation
          </li>
          <li class="project__list-item lead">Usable from a USB thumb drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">With a simple font-end design to make the less skilled
          IT
          technician or end user able to run advanced tests and provide feedback
          to the Network engineer for troubleshooting assessment.</p>
      </div>

  <!-- Aims -->
  <section id="aims" class="about-us aims">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <h2 class="project__heading">Aims</h2>
        <p class="project__text">Although this tool is specifically for Network
          support engineers, it has a very simple purpose of just running a
          simple test with TCP and UDP protocols for either a 30 seconds or 60
          seconds run test, currently, based on this existing tool, network
          engineers are required to physically commute and visit the site
          first-hand to fix to run tests on network issues.</p>
        <p class="project__text">Upon successful completion of this prototype,
          the addition of Easy iPerf Check in a IT professionals toolkit would
          bring so much harmony and joy to an IT professional’s life, just by
          having a simplified way of testing networks without the need of long
          distance travel would greatly benefit time management and enable the
          network support team in an organization to be more focused on
          resolving performance issues within the network.</p>
        <p class="project__text">If the Network engineer were to ask the client
          to run the tool on their behalf, generally the client would have
          little to no experience with IT to run this tool. Easy Perf Check was
          inspired from the challenge's IT professionals may experience when
          providing network support due to end-users having minimal technical
          support.</p>
        <p class="project__text">The base construct of the Easy Perf Check Tool
          is the most important part of the entire project. This is where we
          integrate of the command prompt and command lines into a user-friendly
          interface.</p>
        <p class="project__text">By using python to migrate an Auto-run feature,
          the user simply has to press a button to run a series of commands
          without having any knowledge or technical skills.</p>
        <p class="project__text">The use of a (UI stack developer) would be
          needed in to assist with the creation of a sequence of commands within
          Python to automate the process of running the iPerf software within
          the Easy Perf Check Tools systematic program.</p>
        <p class="project__text">Upon successful migration of the Auto-run
          feature in the project, the program will have the basic functionality
          to perform the required specified tasks needed by the Network support
          team.</p>
        <p class="project__text">Further advancements and fine tuning can be
          applied as additional functionality or feature sets to the project at
          a later date.</p>
        <p class="project__text">Upon completion of the Auto-run feature
          integration, further fine tuning to usability within the user
          interface can be accomplished. This could include the addition of an
          email client to enable the results from the Easy Perf Check to be sent
          back to the Network support team’s email.</p>
        <p class="project__text">Although it is not necessary for the purpose of
          running the tests, it will definitely add to the user friendliness of
          the entire project, also the use of a (UI stack developer) would be
          needed in the assistance of enhancing this part of the project.</p>

        <h2 class="project__heading">Plans and Progress</h2>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">Details about what the project will do
          </h3>
          <p class="project__text">Easy Perf Check (iPerf) is a tool for IT
            professionals such as network engineers or users with less technical
            skills to troubleshoot network issues by choosing to run the 4
            different tests available. There are TCP and UDP tests both have the
            option for 30-second and 60-second tests.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Easy Perf Check has a more simplistic
            front-end to accommodate a wide range of users to function, where
            the front-end can also be customised for different businesses to
            suit their needs around diagnostic routines.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Furthermore, if the user requires additional
            assistance with interpreting the results, there is an option to send
            the test results to a network engineer to assist them with the
            problem remotely. Currently, based on the existing tools, network
            engineers are required to physically commute and visit the sites to
            troubleshoot and to run tests on networks. Easy Perf Check will
            improve efficiency, user experience satisfaction and functionality
            when network services are required and provided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">How will you do it</h3>
          <p class="project__text">The production of Easy Perf Check will
            require a strong Internet connection with static IP which would be
            received from Fibre Internet Connection. A DNS A record will be used
            to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address to allow virtual
            networking testing to be achieved.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Server hardware with at least one Network
            Interface controller (NIC) has the purpose of connecting a computer
            to a computer network when a Network Engineer needs to access the
            user’s system remotely to fix
            network issues.</p>
          <p class="project__text">A Virtual server – Windows Server 2019
            DataCenter will be used to share hardware and software resources
            with other operating systems to collect data from other devices
            remotely. The Windows Server 2019 datacentre provides sufficient
            resources to support a highly virtualised datacentre
            and cloud environments to store information and data collected.</p>
          <p class="project__text">A Cisco ASA 5516-X will be used for the
            firewall, which is a security device that offers defence against
            third-party treats and antivirus protection as well virtual private
            network (VPN) qualities to monitor and prevent threats. The Cisco
            ASA 5516-X will be crucial in protecting confidential data for the
            prototype as well as customer’s information.</p>
          <p class="project__text">The clients or users will need to have access
            to an Internet connection via a computer or laptop with a supported
            Windows operating system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">How it began and how it progressed
          </h3>
          <p class="project__text">Within group 12, the project idea began from
            Jason Davis who has had over 10 years of IT industry experience
            whilst working as a Network Engineer. The team members have read
            through each other’s project ideas from Assignment 1 where all the
            team members mutually decided to pursue Easy Perf Check as our
            project idea in Assignment 2.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Easy Perf Check was inspired on the
            challenges that IT professionals may experience when providing
            network support due to end-users having minimal technical knowledge.
            Jason has dedicated time in explaining the features and functions of
            Easy Perf Check and the significant impacts it would have on
            society.</p>
          <p class="project__text">When the team reached the stage of starting
            Assignment 3, the project idea contributed to 50% of the assignment
            marks and, as a team, we focused on discussing applying additional
            innovative functions to the tool. There was a constructive
            discussion held during the first group meeting to commence
            Assignment 3 where 2 parties discussed the advantages and
            limitations of adding additional features to Easy Perf Check which
            were not addressed in Assignment 1.</p>
          <p class="project__text">There was debate around whether the project
            idea would be hypothetically more valuable to have multiple
            functions or features to improve the cost-efficiency and attract
            investment opportunities. Alternatively, it was argued that a
            product with minimal functions but providing a specialised function
            that is highly demanded would also be equally attractive to
            investors.</p>
          <p class="project__text">During the second meeting afterwards, the
            group incorporated the practice of majority votes to finalise the
            decision. The consensus was that only the initial features
            highlighted in Assignment 2 are sufficient for a MVP (minimum viable
            product), however as a compromise the whole group came to a mutual
            decision to consider additional feature to Easy Perf Check. E.g.
            End-users would be able to complete a survey after using the tool to
            record their experience with the tool.</p>
          <p class="project__text">The data gathered from the survey could
            potentially provide valuable insights into customer experience and
            understand additional customer needs which could be considered for
            future enhancements to the tool. The survey function was
            realistically feasible to be incorporated to the tool, similarly to
            the central concept of having Easy Perf Check, also adding value to
            stakeholders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">What stage of the plan are you up to
          </h3>
          <p class="project__text">The group has currently agreed and finalised
            on the features Easy Perf Check should have at the stage of
            completing Assignment 3. The front-end design of the application has
            been completed which can be accessed in the application package. The
            front-end design shows 4 options for users to run either TCP or UDP
            tests for a combination of 30 seconds or 60 seconds.</p>
          <p class="project__text">There is also an option button to send
            results. One of the team members has also run 1 test for 30 seconds
            for UDP. A working prototype written in Python has also been
            included in the application package to illustrate the running of the
            tool. The next phase of the project includes linking the designed
            front-end to the back-end technologies, possibly going through a
            future stage of technology stack analysis.</p>
          <p class="project__text">It is sometimes useful to define roles for
            particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or Technical
            Designer, or User Interface Designer. It is also possible that roles
            are changed from week to week, depending on what needs to be done
            next. Have you defined any specific roles for your project? If so,
            describe and justify these. If not, describe your process and
            justify why there are no specific roles.</p>
