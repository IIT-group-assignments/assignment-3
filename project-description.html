        <p class="lead">With Easy Perf Check your users can run network
          diagnostics from the comfort of their home with the
          click of a button. The results are sent to you and you can
          provide adequate support.</p>
        <p class="lead">This project will create a tool, that would be a great
          addition to a
          Network engineer’s toolkit. By making a substantial improvement to the
          existing iPerf software, we are creating a user interface that is:</p>
        <ul class="project__list">
          <li class="project__list-item lead">Portable</li>
          <li class="project__list-item lead">Requiring no software installation
          </li>
          <li class="project__list-item lead">Usable from a USB thumb drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">With a simple font-end design to make the less skilled
          IT
          technician or end user able to run advanced tests and provide feedback
          to the Network engineer for troubleshooting assessment.</p>

  <!-- Aims -->
  <section id="aims" class="about-us aims">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <h2 class="project__heading">Aims</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="project__text">Although this tool is specifically for
            Network
            support engineers, it has a very simple purpose of just running a
            simple test with TCP and UDP protocols for either a 30 seconds or 60
            seconds run test, currently, based on this existing tool, network
            engineers are required to physically commute and visit the site
            first-hand to fix to run tests on network issues.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Upon successful completion of this prototype,
            the addition of Easy iPerf Check in a IT professionals toolkit would
            bring so much harmony and joy to an IT professional’s life, just by
            having a simplified way of testing networks without the need of long
            distance travel would greatly benefit time management and enable the
            network support team in an organization to be more focused on
            resolving performance issues within the network.</p>
          <p class="project__text">If the Network engineer were to ask the
            client
            to run the tool on their behalf, generally the client would have
            little to no experience with IT to run this tool. Easy Perf Check
            was
            inspired from the challenge's IT professionals may experience when
            providing network support due to end-users having minimal technical
            support.</p>
          <p class="project__text">The base construct of the Easy Perf Check
            Tool
            is the most important part of the entire project. This is where we
            integrate of the command prompt and command lines into a
            user-friendly
            interface.</p>
          <p class="project__text">By using python to migrate an Auto-run
            feature,
            the user simply has to press a button to run a series of commands
            without having any knowledge or technical skills.</p>
          <p class="project__text">The use of a (UI stack developer) would be
            needed in to assist with the creation of a sequence of commands
            within
            Python to automate the process of running the iPerf software within
            the Easy Perf Check Tools systematic program.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Upon successful migration of the Auto-run
            feature in the project, the program will have the basic
            functionality
            to perform the required specified tasks needed by the Network
            support
            team.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Further advancements and fine tuning can be
            applied as additional functionality or feature sets to the project
            at
            a later date.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Upon completion of the Auto-run feature
            integration, further fine tuning to usability within the user
            interface can be accomplished. This could include the addition of an
            email client to enable the results from the Easy Perf Check to be
            sent
            back to the Network support team’s email.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Although it is not necessary for the purpose
            of
            running the tests, it will definitely add to the user friendliness
            of
            the entire project, also the use of a (UI stack developer) would be
            needed in the assistance of enhancing this part of the project.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">Details about what the project will do
          </h3>
          <p class="project__text">Easy Perf Check (iPerf) is a tool for IT
            professionals such as network engineers or users with less technical
            skills to troubleshoot network issues by choosing to run the 4
            different tests available. There are TCP and UDP tests both have the
            option for 30-second and 60-second tests.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Easy Perf Check has a more simplistic
            front-end to accommodate a wide range of users to function, where
            the front-end can also be customised for different businesses to
            suit their needs around diagnostic routines.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Furthermore, if the user requires additional
            assistance with interpreting the results, there is an option to send
            the test results to a network engineer to assist them with the
            problem remotely. Currently, based on the existing tools, network
            engineers are required to physically commute and visit the sites to
            troubleshoot and to run tests on networks. Easy Perf Check will
            improve efficiency, user experience satisfaction and functionality
            when network services are required and provided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">How will you do it</h3>
          <p class="project__text">The production of Easy Perf Check will
            require a strong Internet connection with static IP which would be
            received from Fibre Internet Connection. A DNS A record will be used
            to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address to allow virtual
            networking testing to be achieved.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Server hardware with at least one Network
            Interface controller (NIC) has the purpose of connecting a computer
            to a computer network when a Network Engineer needs to access the
            user’s system remotely to fix
            network issues.</p>
          <p class="project__text">A Virtual server – Windows Server 2019
            DataCenter will be used to share hardware and software resources
            with other operating systems to collect data from other devices
            remotely. The Windows Server 2019 datacentre provides sufficient
            resources to support a highly virtualised datacentre
            and cloud environments to store information and data collected.</p>
          <p class="project__text">A Cisco ASA 5516-X will be used for the
            firewall, which is a security device that offers defence against
            third-party treats and antivirus protection as well virtual private
            network (VPN) qualities to monitor and prevent threats. The Cisco
            ASA 5516-X will be crucial in protecting confidential data for the
            prototype as well as customer’s information.</p>
          <p class="project__text">The clients or users will need to have access
            to an Internet connection via a computer or laptop with a supported
            Windows operating system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">How it began and how it progressed
          </h3>
          <p class="project__text">Within group 12, the project idea began from
            Jason Davis who has had over 10 years of IT industry experience
            whilst working as a Network Engineer. The team members have read
            through each other’s project ideas from Assignment 1 where all the
            team members mutually decided to pursue Easy Perf Check as our
            project idea in Assignment 2.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Easy Perf Check was inspired on the
            challenges that IT professionals may experience when providing
            network support due to end-users having minimal technical knowledge.
            Jason has dedicated time in explaining the features and functions of
            Easy Perf Check and the significant impacts it would have on
            society.</p>
          <p class="project__text">When the team reached the stage of starting
            Assignment 3, the project idea contributed to 50% of the assignment
            marks and, as a team, we focused on discussing applying additional
            innovative functions to the tool. There was a constructive
            discussion held during the first group meeting to commence
            Assignment 3 where 2 parties discussed the advantages and
            limitations of adding additional features to Easy Perf Check which
            were not addressed in Assignment 1.</p>
          <p class="project__text">There was debate around whether the project
            idea would be hypothetically more valuable to have multiple
            functions or features to improve the cost-efficiency and attract
            investment opportunities. Alternatively, it was argued that a
            product with minimal functions but providing a specialised function
            that is highly demanded would also be equally attractive to
            investors.</p>
          <p class="project__text">During the second meeting afterwards, the
            group incorporated the practice of majority votes to finalise the
            decision. The consensus was that only the initial features
            highlighted in Assignment 2 are sufficient for a MVP (minimum viable
            product), however as a compromise the whole group came to a mutual
            decision to consider additional feature to Easy Perf Check. E.g.
            End-users would be able to complete a survey after using the tool to
            record their experience with the tool.</p>
          <p class="project__text">The data gathered from the survey could
            potentially provide valuable insights into customer experience and
            understand additional customer needs which could be considered for
            future enhancements to the tool. The survey function was
            realistically feasible to be incorporated to the tool, similarly to
            the central concept of having Easy Perf Check, also adding value to
            stakeholders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">What stage of the plan are you up to
          </h3>
          <p class="project__text">The group has currently agreed and finalised
            on the features Easy Perf Check should have at the stage of
            completing Assignment 3. The front-end design of the application has
            been completed which can be accessed in the application package. The
            front-end design shows 4 options for users to run either TCP or UDP
            tests for a combination of 30 seconds or 60 seconds.</p>
          <p class="project__text">There is also an option button to send
            results. One of the team members has also run 1 test for 30 seconds
            for UDP. A working prototype written in Python has also been
            included in the application package to illustrate the running of the
            tool. The next phase of the project includes linking the designed
            front-end to the back-end technologies, possibly going through a
            future stage of technology stack analysis.</p>
          <p class="project__text">It is sometimes useful to define roles for
            particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or Technical
            Designer, or User Interface Designer. It is also possible that roles
            are changed from week to week, depending on what needs to be done
            next. Have you defined any specific roles for your project? If so,
            describe and justify these. If not, describe your process and
            justify why there are no specific roles.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">Overall Description</h3>
          <p class="project__text">The purpose of this project is to develop a
            tool that makes network performance testing, specifically
            throughput, more user friendly.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Building on the iPerf tool and adding a
            user-friendly interface to the client side of the testing, to enable
            a less skilled individual to execute specific tests and submit the
            results back to a network engineering support person to be assessed.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project__subheading">Deliverables</h3>
          <p class="project__text">A portable application which can be stored on
            a USB drive, that will auto run when inserted into a PC. The
            application will contain a simple UI with 5 buttons, 4 of the
            buttons will be used to run tests, and the 5th button will be used
            to submit results back to the network engineer requesting the
            testing.</p>

          <h3 class="project__subheading">Justification</h3>
          <p class="project__text">The justification for this project is that
            iPerf, while a highly useful and functional tool, however it lacks
            user friendliness. A user must be familiar with the command line,
            and command line switches, understand the default settings for
            bandwidth use for TCP and UDP traffic, and many other variations.
          </p>
          <p class="project__text">The UI can be configured to use specific IPs
            for testing, enabling a standard user with no installation rights or
            other admin rights, to execute the test and send results back to the
            support team.</p>
          <p class="project__text">This will enable the network support team in
            an organisation to be more focused on resolving performance issues,
            rather than needing to travel to a remote site, just to run a test.
          </p>
          <p class="project__text">If network performance is in a degraded
            state, having a support person remotely connect to a site may not be
            possible, and may influence the test results, especially on high
            latency connections like satellite.</p>

          <h3 class="project__subheading">Assumptions</h3>
          <p class="project__text">Assumptions made for this project are that it
            will initially be developed for testing private WAN connections in
            corporate environments, where frequently servers and applications
            are centralised, while staff of the organisation are based at other
            locations.</p>
          <p class="project__text">This testing can also be utilized for testing
            the performance of links over an IPSec VPN from a remote office,
            back to private cloud hosted infrastructure in a datacentre. Testing
            the ability of routers and firewalls to encrypt and decrypt traffic
            on the path, which is a process that can impact the throughput of
            traffic between client and server.</p>
          <p class="project__text">This will initially be developed for use in a
            Windows client environment, with the deployment of the server end
            connection available in either Windows or Linux form. The
            application can be set to run as a daemon on an existing server or
            be setup as a standalone virtual machine on existing infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h3 class="project__subheading">Exclusions</h3>
          <p class="project__text">Exclusions for this project are to exclude
            any development and testing against Apple PC devices, or portable
            devices at this stage, such as tablets and phones. The reason for
            this is simply that this product is not designed to test generic
            network accessibility, but specific network performance in the
            ability of a link to sustain and maintain throughput, without a
            large amount of jitter.</p>
          <p class="project__text">Jitter on a network can be catastrophic for
            applications such as voice, video, and other intensive applications
            such as SQL.</p>
          <p class="project__text">As mobile devices are not often used as an
            endpoint for LAN/WAN connectivity inside an organisation, these
            devices have been excluded from development and testing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="project__subheading">Constraints</h3>
          <p class="project__text">The major constraint is to have a network
            available for testing, with a WAN segment. For testing and proof of
            concept purposes, a server has been configured to run as an iPerf
            server daemon in a datacentre in Adelaide. The server is a Windows
            Server 2019 DataCenter virtual machine, running on Dell R730
            hardware. The server is protected by a Cisco ASA and has rules to
            permit only traffic on the iPerf ports, NAT rules for a public IP
            address and a DNS A record for public DNS availability.
            Additionally, the firewall is running FirePower IPS and is scanning
            all traffic for attack signatures. The scanning of this traffic will
            limit the performance, but it is expected this performance will be
            adequate for testing and demonstration purposes. These constraints
            would unlikely be present in a private WAN environment, as IPS in
            particular, is normally only used on a boundary to a public network
            like the Internet.</p>
          <p class="project__text">On the front-end side, there are significant
            constraints that are yet to be solved. If not mitigated, these
            constraints may render the initial product implementation concept
            not viable and may require a review of the technology stack used to
            implement the product functionality. The main constraints are listed
            below:</p>

          <ul class="project__list--disc">
            <li class="project__list-item"><strong>Auto-run feature:</strong>
              The application entry point is an html file that needs to run
              automatically when the thumb drive is connected to the PC.
              However, security guidelines implemented from Windows 8 do not
              allow for an autorun.inf file to run automatically, unless the
              Windows settings are specifically customised to allow for that.
              Apart from corporate environments, where admin settings are
              defined globally and users unable to change these settings, there
              is no control over this. This represents a potential scenario,
              where the user would need to run the application manually.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item"><strong>Executing *.exe files from
                html documents:</strong>The initial product concept relies on
              triggering the execution of the iPerf executable (iperf3.exe +
              switches) from the html, either via <em>a</em>, <em>button</em>,
              or <em>input</em>
              tags. However, due to security restrictions, local files, such
              as the files stores in the thumb drive packages folder, cannot
              be triggered directly from the html file.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="project__text">Alternative explored implementations can
            also add additional constraints.</p>

          <ul class="project__list--disc">
            <li class="project__list-item"><strong>JavaScript (JS):</strong>
              using JS to trigger an event listener executing the iPerf command
              is also not an option for the same reason. Vanilla JS in its
              current version cannot execute local files, similarly to html.
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item"><strong>ActiveX:</strong> an ActiveX
              object can be executed, although all modern browsers have ceased
              to support ActiveX commands, due to security concerns. In our
              initial testing, Internet Explorer was able to trigger the
              command. However, as we can’t guarantee that users will have
              Internet Explorer installed and as their default browser, this was
              also considered a non-viable option.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item"><strong>NodeJS:</strong> Node JS can
              access local files, however its scripts need to be run from a web
              server. Therefore, this was not considered a viable option, as our
              product needs to be able to be accessed locally when the user does
              not have access to a network as well as when the network traffic
              is unreliable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="project__text">This could be done however using other
            technologies not yet explored in depth at this stage, such as PHP,
            Python (Flask or django), Java or C# (.NET Core).</p>

          <ul class="project__list--disc">
            <li class="project__list-item"><strong>User does not have an email
                client:</strong> Another feature that include constraints, from
              a technology implementation perspective, relates to the way that
              the user informs the network support team. When the user presses
              the ‘Send’ button, a ‘mailto:’ link is run attaching the test
              results files to the email and addressing it to the support team
              email address. There are 2 limitations that need to be addresses
              before this solution can be implemented: poor network traffic may
              render emailing difficult or impossible, and if the user does not
              have an email client installed at the moment they attempt to send
              the test results, no email is generated.

            <li class="project__list-item">Easy Perf Check is a tool that relies
              on strong network connection to function especially when a network
              engineer is attempting to provide support to another user
              remotely.
              There may be potential risks arising when sending test results or
              working around VPN if Internet Connection is not stable.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">There are also concerns around fraud
              and security when providing network support remotely as both
              parties
              are not able to see each other face-to-face. Ideally, the end-user
              will need to authorise the network engineer to access their
              systems
              to run tests. There could be possibilities where access is
              provided
              to a fraudulent party or scammer resulting in breach of data and
              stolen confidential information.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">iPerf does not work in public
              environments such as in university setting, shopping centres or
              libraries thus the tool may not function if network issues are
              experienced in public places.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">Running tests with iPerf works more
              effectively with cable connections over wireless connections. The
              inherent limitations of wireless connections need to be understood
              before executing an iPerf test over wireless. Wireless is a shared
              medium, and runs only in half duplex, which makes a TCP test
              invalid.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">There is a risk that the iPerf tool
              could be modified to intentionally cause network degradation by
              stressing a WAN link with a UDP flood, which may induce a TCP
              global
              synchronization event, causing further performance and congestion
              on
              a link.</li>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p class="project__text">The amount, style and quantity of
            Communication has been described as one of the key elements in
            determining team success in achieving its goals. (Martin, 2003)
            Building on this premise, in this project, the team established open
            channels of communication that could foster a highly open and
            productive environment and solid processes to support collaboration.
          </p>
          <p class="project__text">The group developed a communication strategy
            including 3 components to support the processes and procedures
            required in order to deliver the Easy Perf Check solution project
            successfully, in a timely manner, whilst using team members’ skills
            to the fullest. These processes and strategies are described below.

          <h3 class="project__subheader">Synchronous Communication</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="project__list-item">As the project has taken place over a
              period of 4 weeks, one of the most important strategies to
              follow-up on the project progress was the weekly meeting on
              Wednesdays. All team members received MS Teams invitations via
              email for the Wednesday meeting and were able to connect to the
              platform using the emailed link or the team Calendar in Teams. In
              most weeks a second meeting was also scheduled to take place on
              the Sunday at a mutually agreed time.<br>
              The meetings followed a pre-defined agenda going through each part
              of the project and each responsible team member shared an update
              will other team members on the progress of each task.<br>
              MS Teams was a great choice of collaboration tool for meetings, as
              the team had all its members in different geographical locations
              and time zones. Its features of having all team members to share
              video and audio, exchange files, screen-sharing, meeting recording
              were extremely important.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">Another important aspect of the
              synchronous communication processes was the ability to collaborate
              on document editing at the same time. MS Teams was fundamental to
              enable this requirement. Team members were able to edit the same
              document at the same time in different parts of the document while
              chatting or during a voice call.</li>

              also took place via chat, on Teams. The ability to send messages
              to other team members or to the whole group sped up the resolution
              of issues and the flow of information so that there was no need to
              wait for the weekly meeting to speak to other team members,
              request for information, opinions, exchange files, obtain feedback
              among other communication needs.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">On occasion, email was a
              communication redundancy tool to ensure that all team members
              received the message when it was of upmost importance. The group
              found that in some situations, MS Teams was not as reliable as
              required, with multiple team members having work and university
              Teams accounts on the same device, being exposed to the real
              possibility of missing an important message. Although this
              was used only sparingly</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">As mentioned earlier, the ability to
              record meetings was vital for team collaboration. When a team
              member was unable to attend a meeting – which happened in the
              beginning of the project with one retired team member on the
              London time zone – they would still be able to catch-up with the
              discussions and participate later in the group chat to clarify any
              aspects and contribute as required.</li>

          <h3 class="project__subheader">Project Control and Execution</h3>
          <ol>
            <li class="project__list-item">The final strategy relates to
              controlling and recording team progress so that all team members
              were always aware of the status of any task. Task assignment was
              based on the team discussions in the Wednesday meetings. Team
              meeting discussions were recorded in meeting minutes and saved on
              the group file repository in MS Teams. The minutes contained a
              brief description of each task, the discussion, future action, an
              assigned team member and an agreed upon deadline.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">To enable the team to track task
              progression between team meetings, the group chose an industry
              Agile project management tool. A Trello board was created, and
              cards added to assign each task to a team member, pair or trio
              sub-teams to work on tasks. Progress was then recorded against
              each card in tasks and comments. Each task had a deadline and a
              colour code was used to signal potential focus areas.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">All project documentation was saved
              in a central repository in MS Teams so that all team members had
              access to all files at all times. This strategy was particularly
              important to enable asynchronous document peer review.</li>
            <li class="project__list-item">The final process implemented in the
              project relates to the tool and website version control and
              storage. GitHub was used to host the codebase for the project
              front-end prototype and the Easy Perf Check project website,
              during development and to host the Production version.</li>
