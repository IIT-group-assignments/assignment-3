        <h3 class="it-technologies__heading" id="infrastructure">Clouds,
          Services, Servers</h3>
        <div class="technologies__columns">
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Cloud computing is a relatively
            new
            technology which has dramatically influenced the adoption of
            technology in businesses. There are 3 main types of cloud services.
            Public, Private and Hybrid.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Public clouds are those which are
            available to anyone. A business buys an instance or instances of
            virtual computing space or storage space, which are hosted on
            computers somewhere in the world. You are unlikely to ever know
            where
            the computers are, who has access to the data, or even what sort of
            hardware is behind the service. The main players in this market are
            Microsoft with their Azure platform, Amazon with the AWS platform,
            and
            Google also now have a similar offering Google Cloud.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">In the simplest terms, a Cloud
            platform is a computer which you can use, but you don’t own, and is
            not located at your own premises.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">A private cloud is a little
            different. While the services you are accessing are still not
            located at your business premises, but likely located in a
            specialised data centre, they belong to you. You are responsible for
            the cost of hardware, software and maintenance and upgrades. You
            likely pay a fee for an amount of rack space you are using and have
            an allowance for data and power usage. Included in the fee is the
            facility, security, air conditioning and other environmental factors
            such as fire detection and suppression.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">A Hybrid solution can be either a
            combination of public and private, or on-premises and public or
            private. An example might be, having your servers and data onsite,
            but using a public cloud as a backup repository, and using a public
            cloud for a development environment. Or you may use an on-premises
            solution for your core infrastructure, while replicating data to a
            private datacentre environment for use as a disaster recovery
            environment.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Utilizing public cloud storage is
            very popular for backup storage. Both Azure Blobs and AWS S3 or
            Glacier are popular choices, as putting data in is free – you only
            pay for the space you consume, and storage is reliable with a high
            availability. Public cloud storage is an ideal option for businesses
            who seek long term reliable storage that is cost efficient.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">One of the main benefits to a
            business of using a cloud environment is simply the scalability. If
            you need a new or additional server, you can run a new virtual
            server up in PowerShell using Microsoft Azure in a few minutes. No
            hardware expenditure involved. You only pay for the time that your
            server is on and running. So, it is extremely flexible for
            application and database development which may need a lot of
            resources but might only be used for a few hours per day. This way,
            you only need to pay for the time that the server is running. Shut
            it down when finished, and the charging stops.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The availability and easy
            accessibility of cloud services has also led to an abundance of new
            services. Some of the very first of these were Microsoft’s Fleet of
            Office365 products. Where, you no longer need to buy a server,
            software and licensing to have your own Microsoft Exchange server.
            Now a business can gain all the functionality of Microsoft Exchange,
            for a small monthly cost per user. This is also flexible. Instead of
            needing to buy your Exchange licenses in bundles of 10, 25, 50 or
            100. You can add as many as you like, or as few as you like at a
            time. You can also flexibly use add and remove licenses at a time.
            You can bundle the mail license with an office license, giving each
            user account the latest full Microsoft Office suite products, as
            well as OneDrive storage, MS Teams, and other collaboration
            products. These initial services have led to other services, such as
            SaaS, where you can pay a software vendor for a cloud instance of
            their software. No need to run a physical or virtual server
            on-premises, or even a cloud server, you simply pay to use the
            software as you go. The software vendor is responsible for the
            entire hardware and software platform. You just use the software.
          </p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">One of the newest iterations of
            the cloud computing environment, is DaaS. Desktop as a Service,
            where you can gain access to a virtual desktop computer, with all
            your organization’s software installed. This is ideal for people
            working from home and is popular in large educational institutions
            where a thin client is used to access a virtual desktop for
            students. The desktop computer follows the student around to their
            classes or any other device they access it from.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">These services also have a large
            benefit for the vendor of the product. Their costs for updates are
            greatly reduced. They no longer have to produce CD/DVD media to
            distribute updates, or new license keys for new versions. They can
            simply update a central server, and all users of the software will
            then be using the latest version of the software. Managing licenses
            and income is much easier for the vendor also. Licenses are often
            linked to your business e-mail addresses, making software piracy and
            sharing of license keys almost impossible.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">This is not having a detrimental
            impact on jobs in the industry, but rather an increase in jobs. The
            types of jobs maybe slightly different, but it is still a growth
            industry. There has been a huge growth in datacentre installations
            Australia wide, and globally. These environments still need support.
            However, the support roles have often shifted from the business
            premises, to the datacentre itself.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The main impact this has had on IT
            professionals, is a need to upskill. To understand how to utilize
            and manage cloud platforms, how to offer customers an option to take
            up and utilize the benefits offered by cloud computing. There is new
            terminology, new skills, and especially new attack surfaces to
            consider</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">One of the main benefits to end
            users has been seen over the interesting times with Covid 19
            restrictions. So many industries have been able to continue to
            function successfully, with almost their entire workforces
            functioning in geographically different locations, yet maintaining
            connectivity through cloud platforms like Teams, Skype for Business,
            Webex, still working utilizing the same resources through
            SharePoint, and doing all this securely via full tunnel VPNs.</p>

        <h3 class="it-technologies__heading" id="cyber">Cybersecurity</h3>
        <div class="technologies__columns">
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Cybersecurity is not new
            technology. Security in IT has been around for a long time, but with
            the increased number of malicious actors and the ease at which
            threats can be deployed, has changed the threat-scape immensely in
            the past 5 years.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Theories of the first virus or
            worm were developed by mathematicians as early as the 1940s. But the
            first virus that had some sort of malicious intent was not developed
            until 1974. This was known as the Rabbit virus. The first virus
            designed to impact the personal computer was in 1986 and would
            infect the boot sector of a 5 ¼” floppy drive. Although this virus
            was not malicious.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The spread or replication of
            malicious software, either viruses or worms, used to be slow. It
            depended on people sharing a floppy disk initially, and then
            followed with people downloading the same file from a website, or
            via e-mail.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">In modern times, the spread of a
            threat is no longer slow. Cyber criminals use bots, and other
            methods of spreading malicious software.
          </p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs"> Initially, a worm or a virus’
            malicious intent was to crash your
            computer, or make it run so slow, it was impossible to use. However,
            with the advent of almost impossible to trace crypto currencies,
            ransomware is now the popular threat. Ransomware can also be used to
            deliver a RAT – remote access trojan –
            to infected machines. The impact to a business of this type of
            attack
            can be catastrophic.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The first goal of Ransomware is to
            make your system unusable. To trap
            you into needing something the cybercriminal has and you do not – an
            encryption key. The ransomware program searches your hard drive, and
            initially encrypted anything that had a certain file extension. Such
            as .jpg, .png, .doc, .xls and those sorts of user files.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Modern ransomware is capable of
            being a lot smarter. Identifying if a computer is part of a Windows
            domain, and then hunting the network for a file server, to encrypt
            the contents of a shared folder. Hunting the network for a server
            listening on TCP 1433 – which indicates an SQL based database is
            present on the network. Then, silently attacking that SQL database
            server hoping it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited. All this
            is done for the purpose of gaining a ransom. However, it is becoming
            increasingly prevalent, that it is not just the ransom the malicious
            actor is seeking, but saleable data. This is also used a leverage
            point, to ensure the ransom gets paid.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">If data can be exfiltrated from a
            network, and the data can then be held to ransom outside of the
            organisation, the prospects of having your ransom paid is much
            higher. Not only for the reason of the bad publicity it may attract,
            but the release of certain types of data maybe very valuable.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">On occasions, ransomware is used
            for industrial espionage purposes.
            One recent example of this was the defence contractor in Adelaide
            who
            was infiltrated due to a hole in the network left by an unskilled IT
            company, which allowed a foreign government to infiltrate the
            organisation undetected for over 6 months. Plans for the Royal
            Australian Navy’s 2 helicopter aircraft carriers were stolen, and
            later offered for sale as proof of theft on the dark web. These 2
            ships cost the Australian Government over $3 billion dollars, and
            due
            to a simple mistake, their top-secret designs were accessed. Will
            this
            make them vulnerable in a wartime scenario, or for espionage. It is
            very likely.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Cyber security is generally always
            a reactive response. As, it can be
            difficult to fix vulnerabilities, until someone finds them, and
            often
            tries to exploit them.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">It is certainly not possible to
            have a computer network which is
            completely impervious to all threats. However, a layered security
            approach, using the network as a sensor, and most importantly, user
            training is all needed to provide the highest levels of security.
            For
            both home and business computing.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">It used to be thought that by
            air-gapping systems, they could be
            secured against breaches. However, this has been proven time and
            time
            again, that air gaps can be jumped. The most notable, and first
            publicly known attack that crossed an air gapped system, was
            Stuxnet.
            The likely impact of these escalations in the ease of cybersecurity
            breaches and attacks is to find more individuals being subjected to
            identify theft, and individuals being blackmailed, or personally
            impacted by the breaches of large organizations.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">This is going to be multiplied by
            the number of IoT devices people are
            placing in their homes and businesses. These devices are generally
            not
            designed with security in mind, and people don’t give much thought
            to
            the actual security of these devices. They are just focused on the
            convenience and the “cool” factor. One of the more famous incidents
            where an IoT device was allowed into a very secure network, and then
            leveraged to act against the network occurred in the USA at a large
            Casino. The Casino employed a connected thermometer for their large
            aquarium in their lobby. The thermometer was able to be attacked.
            Due
            to not being designed with security in mind, but more convenience
            focused, the thermometer was compromised, and attackers used it to
            launch attacks against the network. It was never revealed exactly
            what
            data was stolen, but vast amounts of private data were stolen, and
            was
            suspected to include customer lists of high rollers and their
            financial details.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">There is also an impact on cyber
            warfare. As has been recently seen in
            Australia, since the Australian Government has been calling for an
            independent investigation into Covid-19 sources, there has been a
            noticed increase in port scans, syn attacks, and in particular SQL
            injection attacks originating from large Chinese Telcos, such as
            China
            Telecom. I have personally seen a 50% increase in traffic
            originating
            from Chinese registered IP addresses. Cyber warfare can be used not
            only to steal data, but to cripple a country’s economy, by damaging
            businesses, and therefore business confidence.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">This will have an impact on
            everyone’s daily life going forward. More
            and more people are using connected devices in their homes. Google
            Home, Amazon Alexa, and similar devices. These devices have to be
            listening to you all the time. They also have to be connected to a
            server somewhere in the world. The current average time to detect a
            data breach in large organizations, who have a cyber security budget
            is around 200 days. Then a further 60 days to remediate that breach.
            During that time, what sort of data could a malicious actor gain
            access to. Especially with the prevalence of these connected devices
            in homes, and so many people working from home during Covid times.
            How
            often does the CEO read his password out while he taps it into his
            keyboard? If an attacker could gain access to his home network
            through
            an aquarium thermometer, a garden watering system, a weather
            station,
            a baby monitor, a light bulb, what else are they going to be able to
            access, record, steal, listen in to?</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The impact on everyone’s daily
            lives will continue to increase as new
            innovations come to market. Especially when security of the device
            and
            design is not the first requirement of the designs. Identity theft,
            unauthorized access to bank accounts, medical records, credit
            reports,
            will become normal.</p>

        <div class="technologies__columns">
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">What is the state of the art
            of this new technology?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Autonomous vehicles have the
            ability to self- drive the vehicle itself without any human
            interference and be able to detect surrounds for traffic light and
            obstacles based on (Narla, Siva R K. 2013). There could be a driver
            sitting in the driver seat to activate autonomous mode or change
            back to traditional mode for the human to control the vehicle. The
            vehicle is able perform a variety of functions including speeding
            up, slowing down, stopping, turning and parking. Additionally, when
            a human is driving the vehicle, artificial intelligence is in built
            to alert any hazards or interfere by stopping the vehicle to avoid
            collisions. Owners are able to put settings into the car system to
            either drive to set designated locations or make commands for the
            vehicle to find parking itself.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">There are also functions of
            vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) infrastructure which allow each autonomous
            vehicle to communicate between nearby vehicles through short-range
            wireless data exchange. The V2V communication allow the vehicle to
            detect threats within a 360-degree range.</p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">What can be done now?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Autonomous vehicles are able to
            drive the vehicle itself without human intervention including basic
            driving functions of turning, reversing and driving straight. The
            new technology is also able to detect traffic lights and signs to
            ensure it complies with driving regulations for speed limits. The
            V2V communication installed allows the autonomous vehicle to detect
            and communicate with nearby by vehicles to avoid collisions.
            Furthermore, autonomous vehicles are also able to detect threats and
            hazards within a 360-degree range for animals or pedestrians where
            it would be programmed to stop if there is a hazard ahead.
            Additionally, autonomous vehicles also have a smart parking sensor
            installed which enables the vehicle to scan a parking area for an
            available parking space and then automatically self-drive to that
            spot to be parked (García Oya et al., 2018). Self-driving vehicles
            are electric and they become charged from electric or power outlets
            instead of petrol.</p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">What is likely to be able to
            be done soon (next 3 years)?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Autonomous vehicles have had
            significant impact on the way companies allocated factors of
            production. According to (Daily, Medasani, Behringer and Trivedi,
            2017), the Chinese government will promote the adoption of
            autonomous vehicles by 2025 within the trucking industry mainly for
            wide open areas where there is minimal traffic congestion such as
            trucks being driven from airplane or ship to port. In response, Didi
            Chuxing and Geely with ownership holdings in Volvo are all currently
            focusing on restructuring the transportation industry to include
            autonomous vehicles globally.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">When self-driving cars become
            widespread in the future, regular driving patters will be evenly
            distributed to reduce traffic congestions and pollution. In Europe,
            autonomous vehicles of Level 5 have been developed by 2020 thus the
            current focus in one developing the legal framework for accidents
            caused without a human driver. The legal framework might be
            completed after around 3 years.</p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">What technological or other
            developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">According to the U.S. Department
            of Transportation, CV technology has enabled the exchange of
            autonomous vehicle data for position, speed and location. RFID
            Reader on traffic signs has allowed autonomous vehicles to detect
            the reader in order to interpret the traffic signs. (Pérez et al.,
            2010).Vehicular senior networks (VSNs) were used to develop the
            self-car parking system in autonomous vehicles (Correa, Boquet,
            Morell and Lopez Vicario, 2017).Lidar is a radar technology that
            utilise light rays instead of radio waves which has allowed the
            development of autonomous vehicles to have the ability to self-drive
            without a human to steer the wheel or step on the foot pedals. The
            software system Autopilot which includes camera sensors to be
            inbuilt which allows the vehicle to detect surroundings for hazards,
            objects, surrounding vehicles, traffic signs and lights to for safe
            driving.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The Artificial Intelligence aspect
            in autonomous vehicles has enabled the vehicle to detect the
            information around the road, interpreted the observations and make
            decisions in autopilot model in how to be driven.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The potential impact of this
            development may result in reduced car accidents as vehicles are able
            to detect nearby vehicles to communicate and avoid collisions. There
            could be potential benefits to owners of self-driving vehicles to
            have less traffic penalties if the autonomous mode complies with
            road regulations consistently. Furthermore, governments will need to
            review their traffic regulations and laws to consider the factors of
            self-driving cars regarding which parties should be liable in
            situations of failure to comply with traffic rules.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs"></p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">What is likely to change?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The structure of companies
            providing motor vehicle insurance will change regarding the terms
            and conditions they include in product disclosure statements. Motor
            insurance companies might be more integrated with autonomous vehicle
            vendors to debate liabilities for vehicle faults if caused during
            autonomous mode. Additionally, laws regarding driving skill
            requirements may change to become looser resulting in lower demand
            for driving schools. Alternatively, governments may experience
            reduced earnings from the transport sector.</p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">Which people will be most
            affected and how?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Individuals working within the
            public and private transport industry such as bus or taxi drivers
            may
            be strongly affected if the demand for third party transport
            services
            reduce. Automotive or mechanical workers may also be affected as the
            may experience short term structural unemployment as they may not
            have
            the skills or knowledge to provide maintenance required for electric
            autonomous cars.</p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">Will this create, replace or
            make
            redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Autonomous vehicles are expected
            to
            create more jobs within mechanical or electrical engineering in
            producing the technology behind self-driving cars. Since
            self-driving
            vehicles require electricity instead of petrol, the demand for
            electricity may increase resulting in potentially higher electricity
            prices for consumers. Alternatively, the demand for petrol will
            decrease
            if ownership of self-driving cars increases and petrol is not
            required.
            This will result in reduced prices or less volatile petrol prices
            and
            petrol companies may experience reduced revenues than before.</p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">How will this affect you, in
            your
            daily life?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Autonomous vehicles will
            potentially
            provide me with the convenience for the car to self-drive itself
            when I
            commute to work where I could focus on production work instead of
            driving.
            There will also be improved wellbeing for myself when I have saved
            time
            from time cost of commuting and I would potentially have more spare
            time,
            contributing to better work life balance. The ability for the
            vehicle to
            drive autonomously is also a suitable alternative for drivers who
            might be
            tired at times but require to be somewhere. </p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">What will be different for
            you?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The main differences I will
            experience
            is related to car insurance conditions, car maintenance costs and
            potentially insurance claims. I believe car insurance for autonomous
            vehicles may differ from traditional vehicles regarding whether the
            provider of self-driving cars may provide warranty for faults or
            insurance
            to third parties involved in an accident. If a car accident occurs
            while
            the vehicle was in autonomous mode, it is debatable whether the
            driver
            should be liable for the car manufacturer. </p>
          <h4 class="it-technologies__subheading">How might this affect members
            of
            your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Self-driving cars may provide more
            benefits than consequences for my family and friends as most of them
            do
            not drive or have access to vehicles. There are times I usually have
            to
            drive my relatives somewhere where I am required to compensate my
            time. If
            the vehicle has the ability to self-drive, it could potently provide
            my
            relatives with transportation services when they are required
            without
            causing anyone to compensate their time. Furthermore, self-driving
            cars
            also provide benefits from the self-parking system when we attend
            social
            outings in cities where there is extreme traffic congestion and
            difficulties in finding parking. There could be an ideal situation
            where
            my friends and I are dropped off at the venue of event and the car
            is able
            to find a parking spot itself or either drive away to a designated
            spot.
            When we require transportation services after the event, the car
            will be
            able to drive individuals who have consumed alcohol.</p>

            relatively new to world of technology, and they are opening doors in
            many places – literally. Small computing devices are particularly
            prevalent in the IoT – Internet of Things area. This is a relatively
            new area, where devices are being connected to the internet, often
            for the first time.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">We are used to computers, servers,

            3D printers, doorbells, cat tracking collars, light bulbs, HVAC
            thermostats all which are becoming connected devices. Small
            computing devices are allowing this to happen and opening the
            door to the internet to many devices.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">These are also amazing tools for
            learning, and prototyping ideas. What
            used to be prohibitively expensive, in prototyping an idea for a
            small
            device, can now be done cheaply and quickly, the Raspberry Pi would
            be
            one of the most common of these small computing devices.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The Raspberry Pi foundation was
            started in the UK and is a registered
            charity. Their mission is: “To put the power of computing and
            digital
            making into the hands of people all over the world. We do this so
            that
            more people are able to harness the power of computing and digital
            technologies for work, to solve problems that matter to them, and to
            express themselves creatively.”</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The Raspberry Pi is a small,

          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">These devices are also frequently
            used to test security in networks.
            This is by installing attack tools, penetration testing tools onto a
            Raspberry Pi device, using the network port to plug into a switch
            port, and then using the wireless to connect to the Raspberry Pi
            device where you can SSH into the attack tools, and launch attacks
            such as DHCP starvation, CAM overflow attacks and other similar
            network tests.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The functionality and uses of
            these small computing devices are almost

            technology being indispensable for the people in society who suffer
            difficulties with speech, mobility, and life in general. A person
            who

            been detected in certain rooms, and could indicate someone needs
            assistance, or needs to be checked on.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">A connected wheelchair or walking

            a way to compromise a device for their own gains. However, with
            proper
            design and thought put into how these devices can operate securely
            on
            networks. Using technology such as encryption based on PKI would be
            a
            good start to ensuring that access is limited to those who should

            to get milk on the way home, devices that open the garage door for
            you, and then turn on the coffee machine when you get home, so you
            don’t have to wait.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Possibly even one day, you will
            walk into your favourite coffee shop,
            which will be fully automated, and your exact coffee order will just
            appear, with your name printed on the cup. Perfect temperature,
            perfect strength every day.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">But that real power of connected
            small computing devices, will come
            from what they can do to include the most vulnerable people in
            society, and make them feel connected while still feeling
            independent.
            There could be a real danger of complete disconnection from human
            interaction though. If everything becomes automated, and nobody says
            good morning to you at the coffee shop, nobody adds a little too
            much
            sugar, are we then going to end up completely disconnected from
            life,
            while all our small computing devices are fully connected?</p>
