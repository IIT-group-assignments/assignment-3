      <div class="center fadeInDown">
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p class="lead">Technology organisations, like Easy Perf Check, require
          a lot of collaboration in order to achieve the expected outcomes. This
          is very much true for any industry. However, in IT, it appears that
          there are more obstacles to overcome. Some collaboration tools are
          particular to the IT world, such as code version control (GitHub,
          Bitbucket), agile project management tools (JIRA, Trello). In this
          section, the tools and technologies used in the Easy Perf Check
          project are described.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="tools__heading">Collaboration</h3>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">For collaboration and management of the
            workload and deliverables of the project, the team utilised a number
            of tools to cover all requirements. No tool was able to cover all
            the needs of the project. Therefore, a combination of tools was the
            best solution.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Canvas Group</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">RMIT Canvas is a learning management
            system (LMS) designed to facilitate the delivery of content as well
            as collaboration. Among its features are the ability to set-up
            private groups so that students can collaborate in a private
            environment whilst still permitting monitoring by lecturers and
            tutors. </p>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Whilst Canvas Group was initially used
            early in the project, the team opted to use an industry tool instead
            for collaboration, MS Teams. The rationale behind it was to increase
            productivity for the team members who were already familiar with the
            tool and give exposure for team members who were not yet familiar or
            not proficient with the tool.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">MS Teams</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Microsoft Teams is part of the Microsoft
            365 toolkit. It is designed to be a hub to facilitate collaboration
            among team members. During the planning phase of the project, many
            features were essential to the success of the deliverables the Easy
            Perf Check team required. The main features of MS Teams the team
            used were:</p>
          <ul class="tools-list">
            <li class="tools-list-item">Group and individual chat;</li>
            <li class="tools-list-item">Ability to hold group and individual
              voice, video calls and screensharing;</li>
            <li class="tools-list-item">Ability to record and save meeting
              videos;</li>
            <li class="tools-list-item">Ability to be installed both on the
              PC/Mac and mobile. Essential for the communication flow, as most
              team members are unavailable during the day; </li>
            <li class="tools-list-item">File storage and multi-user editing.
              Users able to edit the same document without having to check out,
              merge and manage conflicts.</li>
            <li class="tools-list-item">RMIT email-linked Calendar. Essential
              for scheduling team meetings and ensure that all team members were
              notified of the meetings.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">GitHub</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">GitHub is a remote repository to store
            software development project assets. Github was extensively used for
            version control during the development of the project website. As it
            is a requirement of the project specification, a separate folder
            with all the group’s artifacts was also added to the repository.</p>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">The repository commit history will not
            reflect the collaboration history of the team work in this instance.
            During the production stage of the work, the project GitHub
            repository was used to store the website files only. The team
            collaboration was hosted in MS Teams due to its abundance of
            collaboration features and ease of use, as mentioned earlier.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3 class="tools__heading">Website Development</h3>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">The Easy Perf Check website is a static,
            content-driven, page to illustrate the project planning phase
            outcomes. Below are the main technologies used in its production.
          </p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">HTML Template</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">
            Due to the lack of Web Designers in the Easy Perf Check team, a
            decision was made to implement the website using a free, multi-page
            website template. The template used was the <a
              href="https://www.themehunt.com/">Themehunt</a>'s
            <a
              href="http://themehunt.com/item/1524962-corlate-free-responsive-business-html-template/preview">Corlate</a>
            template.
            The responsive template has a modern look and feel, clear design,
            and universal typography and colour schemes that work in multiple
            platforms. It is also very flexible and easily customisable due the
            exclusive use of well-known CSS and JavaScript (JS) libraries.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">VS Code</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Visual Studio Code is a lightweight
            open-source text editor originally created by Microsoft for quickly
            developing and testing software projects. It has a vast library of
            plugins to enable and optimise the implementation of all of the
            technologies described in this summary.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Command Line Interface (CLI)</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">An implementation of the Windows Subsystem
            for Linux for Windows 10 was implemented in VS-Code to enable the
            use of Git on CLI. The CLI engine used was Git Bash.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Git</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Git is a version control tool that allows
            the easy tracking and collaboration in software development
            projects.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">HTML5</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) is a
            mark-up language that allows web developers to add content to
            websites and web applications. The website implements version 5
            (current).</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">CSS3</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Cascading Stylesheets is the stylesheet
            language that allows web developers to add styles and layout to HTML
            documents. The website implements version 3 (current).</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Java Script (JS)</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">JS is a scripting language that allows the
            browser to process interactivity in web sites and web applications.
            It is the main responsible for component behaviour such as buttons
            that change content on hover, in addition to enabling the
            implementation of basic programs.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Google Fonts</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Google Fonts is a public API commonly used
            in web development that can be implemented to change websites’ font
            families. Available fonts are cross-platform and have multi-browser
            support.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Bootstrap</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Bootstrap is a free to use, open-source
            CSS library, initially created by Twitter. It implements website
            components in an easy and modular way. It is designed to be easy to
            learn, quick and easy to maintain, thus reducing the development and
            testing required time.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Font Awesome</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Font Awesome is a free and subscription
            repository of icons that can be used on websites. Similarly to
            Bootstrap, it was designed to be quick and easy to implement on
            HTML.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">Unsplash</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">Unsplash is a public repository of free
            stock images with free license to use. It has a public API that can
            be used for website testing. However, for the Easy Perf Check
            Production website, images were downloaded and hosted within the
            website directory structure, for increased reliability.</p>
          <h4 class="tools__subheading">GitHub Pages (gh-pages)</h4>
          <p class="tools__paragraph">GitHub pages is a service provided by
            GitHub to enable the hosting and publishing of projects static
            websites. It is easy and quick to implement and has an easy
            Continuous Delivery process.</p>
