        <h2 class="work__header">An Interview with Jason Davis, conducted by
          Luke
          Kelly</h2>
        <p>During the Interview, Jason took the liberty of giving us an
          interesting take on what it’s like to be a Network Engineer,
          throughout the interview he gave exclusive coverage of his daily life
          and what he spends most of his time on as a Network engineer plus the
          challenges that are faced on a daily basis with tools and
          communication, as well as, the difficult path taken to become a
          Network engineer and some great advise on the pathway to becoming a
          Network engineer.</p>
        <div class="work__columns">
          <h4 class="work_subheader">Working as a Network Engineer for the South
            Australian Government</h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Jason’s position working as a Network
            Engineer for the South Australian Government is considered to be a
            Network Assurance role, which means that he is in charge of
            ensuring
            that over 900 educational sites across South Australia remain with
            internet network usage, because Jason specifically works
            with education his role is considered be an essential service, 
            many
            student rely upon Jason’s skills to keep the network
            infrastructure
            in good health so students can continue to study online with ease.
            Part of his role includes monitoring resolving faults when they
            occur while trying to be proactive to avoid complete network
            outages
            for sites.</p>
          <h4 class="work_subheader">Tools of a Network Engineer</h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Although there are a few tools in a
            network engineers toolbox, the main tools that Jason uses in his
            role as a Network Engineer are his laptop, a console cable, and
            a terminal emulator. While there are several terminal emulators
            on the market Jason uses are specific rules and policy-based
            routing in place to enhance student wellbeing and the network
            experience; these include web content filters to make sure kids
            can't get to undesirable websites while at school. Another
            specific tool that is in use is the “iPerf”. IPerf is a tool
            that is used by a Network Engineer to troubleshoot the
            performance of a network. iPerf3 is a tool for active
            measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks.
            It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing,
            buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). For
            each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters.
            The iPerf3 tool sees a lot of use during a network engineers'
            daily life, just like the basic internet speed test like you do
            at home, Jason is constantly using this tool to ensure the
            networks he manages are able to support the learning outcomes
            for students. primarily SecureCRT and Putty. Jason works mainly
            with Cisco hardware which is used as the backbone of the network
            for over 900 individual schools, public high schools, primary
            schools, kindergartens and preschools, this hardware connects
            the schools into a private WAN with the use of Telstra’s wide
            area network. The schools don't connect directly to the
            Internet, rather they connect to a private fibre optic network
            which makes a network engineers life a whole lot easier to
            troubleshoot and manage. This type of network is called a Hub
            and Spoke design, with a central Hub in the Adelaide CBD, and
            each school site acting as a spoke. An example would be a recent
            upgrade of a schools network involving the installation of a new
            Cisco layer three switches and a new subnet so students can
            bring their own laptop or tablet from home, a personal device or
            a device not owned by the school to connect to the internet on a
            different access point, these types of upgrades protect the main
            network from security breaches from external devices, also
            within the subnet there.</p>
          <h4 class="work_subheader">Interacting with other individuals
            within the workplace</h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">As of this year, working from home
            because of COVID-19 restrictions has become standard across
            this industry, which is basically seen Jason’s large office
            building turned into a ghost town. There are several layers of
            interaction and communication with other personnel within this
            field of work, a main part of the role requires constant
            contact with Telstra. As vendors, they provide a wide area
            network that connects educational institutions to a private
            fibre optic network. By having access to a Telstra portal, a
            test can be made on the fibre link to see if the network is
            down. In the event of an issue with the network, part of the
            role is to communicate and report directly with the school's
            director/principal, as well as the school’s IT personnel to
            resolve and trouble-shoot issues within the school's network
            or firewall. On the corporate side of things, communication
            with corporate managers and the chief information officer also
            needs addressing, as updates, issues and outages at the
            educational institutions need to be accurately logged and
            recorded. Jason utilizes the ITIL compliant incident and
            request tracking software, ServiceNow to manage all open
            incidents.</p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">As part of the role, if further
            actions like repairs or upgrades are needed on the network
            infrastructure, Jason would have to send out an infrastructure
            support officer to go out to the site and be the remote eyes
            and hands at a site, who in turn reports back directly to the
            Jason to provide support on completing the repair or upgrade.
          </p>
          <h4 class="work_subheader">A typical day as a Network Engineer
          </h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">At the beginning of the day, the
            first task is to check the monitoring tool for any sites
            that may have gone down overnight, upon finding which sites
            have gone down overnight an investigation is initiated.
            Occasionally an outage is simply caused by a loss of power
            and It's not necessarily a network fault, like everything
            else, routers and switches and NTUs require power to
            operate. Following the check-up, a report must be generated
            every morning for management, including team leaders of
            other areas, to ensure everyone is aware of the status of
            our sites. From there, an investigation is initiated into
            any issues related to sites that are down, plus throughout
            the day other issues or requests may be sent through by the
            service desk team. </p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">An incident in ITIL terms is
            something that should be working, but has stopped, or is
            degraded in how it is working, and a request is simply a
            request for something to be changed. Incidents are things
            like experiencing some slowness in DNS resolutions, or web
            sites loading, or even being unable to resolve certain
            websites. An example of an incident that recently occurred
            was when one of the load balanced Cisco IronPort mail
            appliances went down, so some sites were unable to send
            outbound mail.</p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Coming into the afternoon, there may
            be some room to squeeze in some extra job requests, for
            example, a site may have a new DHCP server being installed,
            and we have to update the IP helper configuration on their
            router or they might be installing an updated reverse proxy
            server, or LMS server (Canvas is an LMS server for
            reference) and need firewall rules updated/changed or
            removed. Incidents always take priority, as normally a site
            is feeling some immediate effect from this, whereas general
            requests take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks for completion.
          </p>
          <h4 class="work_subheader">Challenges within the workplace</h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Firstly, communication is always a challenge
            for a Network engineer. There can be a considerable difference in
            knowledge levels between the different stakeholders, and a network
            engineer needs to be able to communicate to stakeholders at all
            levels. There are IT technicians who understand all the technical
            jargon, and on the other hand, you might have to simplify and
            explain the technical side to educational personnel as they may not
            be that familiar with computers. Therefore, it is considered a
            challenge to ensure that when you're talking to people of different
            skill sets that you can actually explain yourself and explain what's
            happening and what actions you're taking to resolve a problem in a
            diverse sort of way.</p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Then there is fault-finding, it is also very
            challenging, but in a different way. Putting it plainly, it’s almost
            like doing a crossword puzzle but with networking, it is challenging
            to narrow down what is wrong with a network and to then to come up
            with a solution to resolve it. For example, there was a job recently
            where Jason needed to engage with one of Telstra’s engineers in
            Melbourne and go out to a site that was suffering performance
            problems with their link and run a test in conjunction with Telstra.
            The iPerf tool was used to run a sustained throughput test, where
            the fibre connection, with policing disabled, was wound up to around
            about 950mb/s to prove that it could sustain that level of speed.
            Performing this type of test is destructive to the site, as the
            internal network is completely disconnected from the link, to ensure
            no other traffic is present to influence the result. In this
            instance, the performance degradation was proven to a VMWare network
            adaptor using the incorrect driver.</p>
          <h4 class="work_subheader">The best pathway to becoming a network
            engineer</h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Some may ask what it takes to become a
            Network Engineer, with 13 years’ experience Jason recommends the
            best pathway to becoming a network engineer is not only to study,
            but to get some real hands on experience by experimenting, creating
            and practicing in a real networking lab environment, study alone is
            not going to make you a network engineer immediately, however it
            will start to form some foundations for you, after all you are going
            to need some hands on experience to back up these degrees and
            certifications.</p>
          <h4 class="work_subheader">Recommended skill set</h4>
          <p class="work_paragraph">By study, Jason doesn’t necessarily mean a
            degree, diploma or certificate IV or anything like that, but rather
            some specific study directly in the Networking field, So there is a
            framework called the OSI model, which is essentially something that
            developers should use so they can have communications across a
            network, it is broken down into Seven layers, this is really a base
            level education that probably the best path is to really get into
            it, really understand the way traffic flows by understanding the OSI
            model and how it works</p>
          <img src="images/osi-model.jpg" alt="Image of the OSI model"
            class="work__image">
          <p class="work_paragraph">By obtaining a CCNA (Cisco Certified
            Networking Associate) qualification, this will basically step you
            through the fundamentals on how a network works, how a computer can
            talk to another computer somewhere else in the world, and the best
            part of learning networking is that it is not device specific or
            operating system specific. </p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">A good way to study for that is to build
            yourself a lab environment, there is no need to buy a lot of
            expensive fancy equipment, as there are now also a bunch of
            emulators available that do the same task. Cisco themselves produce
            a couple of different emulators that you can sign up with, so you
            can gain that hands-on lab experience without needing to purchase
            the hardware to do it, the main two that Jason recommends are Cisco
            modelling labs and GNS3. </p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">Cisco Modelling Labs allows you to reduce
            your lab costs, this software allows you to run at home a lab
            environment where you can create virtual routers, switches and
            firewalls to experiment with, also (As explained on the GNS3
            website, you can download software that can help you emulate a
            networking lab environment, GNS3 can help you prepare for
            certification exams such as the Cisco CCNA, but also help you test
            and verify real world deployments, so you can use the GNS3 emulator
            today to help you do the same without paying for expensive hardware.
          </p>
          <p class="work_paragraph">The best path is to really get into it,
            really understand the way traffic flows by understanding the OSI
            model and how it works, overall it boils down to getting some real
            hands on experience so you can back up these degrees and
            certifications, and start your pathway to a career in networking.
